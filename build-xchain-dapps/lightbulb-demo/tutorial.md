# 🐣 Tutorial

## Goal

This quickstart guide walks through a [tutorial repo](https://github.com/kleros/vea-lightbulb-tutorial) to deploy a cross-chain application connecting a switch on Arbitrum Goerli to a lightbulb on Chiado or Goerli using the Vea devnet.

The tutorial will deploy contracts which implement the same cross-chain functionality as the Vea Lightbulb [demo](https://vea-lightbulb.vercel.app/).
